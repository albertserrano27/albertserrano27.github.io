### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was my favorite because when I first learned coding in high school I did a guessing game. This one was similar to what did and I really struggled with doing if and else statements. It was nice learning how they work.

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because it was interesting making a code for blackjack. I got to see how the online blackjacks would work kind of. I really like playing blackjack with my family so I was interested in doing this lab.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was my favorite because I was able to make a pattern with the lines of code with I think is interesting. Even though they were just lines it was the beginning of making a pattern.
